# CI/CD Overview

> Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery — the foundation for automated code quality.

## What Is CI/CD?

**Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically building, testing, and validating code every time a developer pushes changes.

**Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Automatically preparing validated code for release to production.

## CI/CD Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Purpose | Tools |
|-------|---------|-------|
| **Source** | Code pushed, PR opened | Git, GitHub |
| **Build** | Compile, bundle, type-check | webpack, tsc, cargo |
| **Lint** | Code style and quality checks | ESLint, Prettier, Ruff |
| **Test** | Unit, integration, E2E tests | Jest, Playwright, pytest |
| **Security** | Vulnerability scanning | CodeQL, Semgrep, Dependabot |
| **Review** | AI and human code review | Copilot, CodeRabbit |
| **Deploy** | Ship to staging/production | Docker, Kubernetes, Vercel |

## Why CI/CD Matters for AI-Assisted Development

AI tools generate code faster than ever. Without CI/CD:
- Bugs ship to production faster
- Security vulnerabilities slip through
- Code quality degrades over time
- Team loses confidence in AI-generated code

**CI/CD is the safety net** that makes AI-assisted development sustainable.

## Key Takeaways

1. **CI catches issues early** — Before they reach production
2. **CD ensures consistency** — Same deployment process every time
3. **Essential for AI code** — Fast generation requires fast validation
4. **Automate everything** — Build, test, scan, review, deploy
